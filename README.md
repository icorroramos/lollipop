Examples of lollipop plots to present scenario analysis results in economic evaluations of health care technologies

A lollipop plot consists of a line (“stick”) connecting a reference axis to a marker (“candy”) which indicates the value of interest (e.g., INMB). 
Use different colours and gradients to emphasize whether the INMB is positive or not, and how far from zero it is. 
Enhance lollipop plots by showing the distributional shape of the INMB by overlaying deterministic lollipop plots with density distributions. Density plots provide a “cloud” around the point estimate. 
A simple Shiny application to create lollipop plots by uploading tables with scenario analyses results in CSV format can be found in this repository or directly accessed through: https://corroram.shinyapps.io/lollipop_scen/.
